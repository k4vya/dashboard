    <h1>
      My Portfolio Ideas
    </h1>
    <p>
      I am an aspiring UX designer at the University of Washington. I'm interested in web design, user research, prototyping, data wrangling and visualization. I am interested in making technology more accessible to people of all ages, abilities, and origins.
    </p>
    <p>
      This capstone project should serve as a digital resume. I want to show the projects I have done, and demonstrate the various skills I 
      have picked up over the years!
    </p>
    <p>
      I also want to somehow visually represent the amount of technical skills I have to show employers the things I can do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want people to learn about my experiences in tech and design and the main takeaways I got from each assignment. I want to include perhaps a reflection of each assignment, and its main learning points.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the aesthetic of my webpage, I really like the minimalist styles, but one of my favorite colors is purple so I want to incorporate that
      as well into the overall look and feel of my page.
